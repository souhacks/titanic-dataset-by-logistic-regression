The titanic and titanic2 data frames describe the survival status of individual passengers
on the Titanic. The titanic data frame does not contain information from the crew, but it
does contain actual ages of half of the passengers.
So summing it up, the Titanic Problem is based on the sinking of the ‘Unsinkable’ ship Titanic in the early 1912. It gives you information about multiple people like their ages, sexes, sibling counts, embarkment points and whether or not they survived the disaster. Based on these features, you have to predict if an arbitrary passenger on Titanic would survive the sinking.
